# Natural Language Processing Techniques

## Preprocessing text

In this project, I preprocess sample text using the NLTK library. I tokenize the text, autocorrect spellings in the text, identify the part of speech of each token, remove stop words from among the tokens, convert each token word into its base form, and identify sentence boundaries in the text.
